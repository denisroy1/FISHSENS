### Proposed role of Canadian participants in the proposed project
Understanding how climate change will impact the availability of Arctic marine living resources is a worldwide
concern (i.e., NordForsk call). A warming Arctic will change harvested species' production, distribution, and
availability, which will have important ecological, economic, and cultural consequences for northern
communities, countries, and international relations. CASTAF: Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Arctic
Fisheries project (#195338), aims to use broad-scale ecosystem modeling to predict the impacts of Arctic
warming on northern-based fisheries in 3 large Arctic marine regions (Barents Sea, Icelandic Sea, and Baffin
Bay). CASTAF plans to use the Atlantis modeling framework, which requires 3 types of data inputs: physical
processes, biological processes supporting exploited resources, and the cultural/economic use of those
resources. Based on this, CASTAF can formulate and offer adaptive management strategies to maintain marine
living resources' sustainability under different Arctic warming scenarios. However, because Arctic marine
resources are less extensively exploited in Canada than in other Arctic countries, there is also a shortage of
primary biological data available as inputs into broader-scale ecological models, such as Atlantis. FISHSENS, an
integrated part of the CASTAF project, will build the much-needed fundamental ecological data on the living
resources that are, and are likely to become, important targets of marine harvesting in Arctic Canada.
FISHSENS: Building Ecological Knowledge to Assess the Sensitivity of Canadian Marine Fishes to Atlantification,
has Northern co-PIs, and will work closely with northern communities to co-produce genomic, chemical tracer,
and movement ecology data for a list of key Arctic marine species supporting productive ecosystems in the
Eastern Canadian Arctic. These data will be used to better understand the trophic interactions, population
dynamics, and behaviours of key marine species, which are the very data needed as critical inputs into the
large region-wide Atlantis models. Thus, results of the FISHSENS project will feed directly into the Atlantis
model being developed for the Eastern Canadian Arctic and the Baffin Bay ecosystems. Together, the CASTAF
and FISHSENS projects pair European expertise on broad-scale marine ecosystem modeling with Canadian
ecologists, economists, and northern resource managers to better understand and safeguard Arctic marinebased
fisheries for the future.

The world is warming, and Arctic marine ecosystems are doing so at 4 times the global average. This allows sub-Arctic species encroachment into Arctic marine areas, creating no-analog ecosystems with unpredictable outcomes. Already at the edge of their thermal tolerances, many native species must either shift their distributions, become extirpated, or be replaced by sub-Arctic predators or competitors. This will impact northerners who rely on marine species for food, cultural symbols, and natural resources supporting local economies. While integrated ecosystem approaches can predict and inform adaptive management strategies coping with warming conditions on species distribution and availability, many species central to Arctic marine ecosystem production, are severely data deficient. For >1400 marine fishes in the Canadian Arctic, knowledge of their population number, size, connectivity, and trophic relationships is insufficient to use as input into ecosystem-based modeling. This limits our ability to apply such large-scale ecosystem models in the Canadian Arctic, as proposed by our NordForsk partners (CASTAF project). As an integrated part of CASTAF, FISHSENS will fill this gap by developing much-needed genomics tools, coupled with diet (chemical tracers), and movement (electronic tracking) data, to assess climate change sensitivity, and predict the population status of Arctic marine fishes. Focal species will be determined by knowledge co-production with northern co-PIs, and derived data will feed into 4 deliverables; (1) Quantifying Arctic marine fishes sensitivity to warming conditions through a sensitivity analysis framework; (2) Generating regional-specific fish monitoring resources (SNP chips) and making monitoring data available to stakeholders through an online data hub; (3) Developing a system of environmental-economic accounts valuing the natural capital of species supporting northern fisheries; and (4) Inputting data into the Atlantis modeling framework (CASTAF) predicting ecosystem-level changes and their consequences on northerner-based fisheries in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Northern co-PIs are pivotal to FISHSENS by providing samples, and management/monitoring advice for the Eastern Canadian Arctic. We know of no other large-scale initiative, in Canada or abroad, intending to use such multidisciplinary techniques to safeguard Arctic marine biodiversity and enabling sustainable outcomes for northern communities affected by a warming world.
