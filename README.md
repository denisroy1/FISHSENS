## International Call Details

### Primary Application ID: 195338
### Primary Application Lead: J. Rasmus Nielsen
### Proposed role of Canadian participants in the proposed project
Understanding how climate change will impact the availability of Arctic marine living resources is a worldwide
concern (i.e., NordForsk call). A warming Arctic will change harvested species' production, distribution, and
availability, which will have important ecological, economic, and cultural consequences for northern
communities, countries, and international relations. _CASTAF: Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Arctic
Fisheries_ project (#195338), aims to use broad-scale ecosystem modeling to predict the impacts of Arctic
warming on northern-based fisheries in 3 large Arctic marine regions (Barents Sea, Icelandic Sea, and Baffin
Bay). CASTAF plans to use the Atlantis modeling framework, which requires 3 types of data inputs: physical
processes, biological processes supporting exploited resources, and the cultural/economic use of those
resources. Based on this, _CASTAF_ can formulate and offer adaptive management strategies to maintain marine
living resources' sustainability under different Arctic warming scenarios. However, because Arctic marine
resources are less extensively exploited in Canada than in other Arctic countries, there is also a shortage of
primary biological data available as inputs into broader-scale ecological models, such as Atlantis. _FISHSENS_, an
integrated part of the _CASTAF_ project, will build the much-needed fundamental ecological data on the living
resources that are, and are likely to become, important targets of marine harvesting in Arctic Canada.
_FISHSENS: Building Ecological Knowledge to Assess the Sensitivity of Canadian Marine Fishes to Atlantification_,
has Northern co-PIs, and will work closely with northern communities to co-produce genomic, chemical tracer,
and movement ecology data for a list of key Arctic marine species supporting productive ecosystems in the
Eastern Canadian Arctic. These data will be used to better understand the trophic interactions, population
dynamics, and behaviours of key marine species, which are the very data needed as critical inputs into the
large region-wide Atlantis models. Thus, results of the FISHSENS project will feed directly into the Atlantis
model being developed for the Eastern Canadian Arctic and the Baffin Bay ecosystems. Together, the _CASTAF_
and _FISHSENS_ projects pair European expertise on broad-scale marine ecosystem modeling with Canadian
ecologists, economists, and northern resource managers to better understand and safeguard Arctic marinebased
fisheries for the future.

## Summary of Proposal
The world is warming, and Arctic marine ecosystems are doing so at four times the global average. This is leading to sub-Arctic species encroachment into Arctic marine areas, creating no-analog ecosystems with unpredictable outcomes. Already at the edge of their thermal tolerances, many native species must either shift their distributions or be replaced by sub-Arctic competitors. Such ecosystem changes will impact Inuit communities, which value marine species for food, culture, and local economies. Integrated ecosystem modeling approaches can predict the impacts of warming conditions on species distribution and availability, informing adaptive  management strategies. Yet, for many marine fishes in the Canadian Arctic, knowledge of their population number, size, connectivity, and trophic relationships is insufficient to use as input into ecosystem-based modeling, as proposed by our NordForsk partners (CASTAF project). As an integrated part of CASTAF, FISHSENS will fill this gap by engaging in knowledge co-production with Nunavummiut
communities combining western science and Inuit knowledge to produce basic ecological knowledge on key Arctic marine fishes. This combined knowledge will feed into five deliverables: (1) identification of community based priority fish species on which to focus data development, (2) assessment of Arctic marine fishesâ€™ sensitivity to warming conditions through a sensitivity analysis framework, (3) co-generation of useful fish monitoring tools for Nunavut stakeholders, (4) an economic and cultural valuation of key marine fishes to Nunavummiut, and finally (5) integration of this knowledge into the modeling framework proposed by CASTAF to predict ecosystem-level changes and their consequences for the Eastern Canadian Arctic. The northern co- PI is pivotal to FISHSENS by liaising with stakeholders and Indigenous knowledge holders and providing management/monitoring advice for the region. We know of no other large-scale initiative, in Canada or abroad, using such multidisciplinary techniques to safeguard Arctic marine biodiversity and to enable sustainable development of northern communities affected by climate change.
